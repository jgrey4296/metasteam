1) visualisations are classes with three methods:
registerData - this takes data from the hub and transforms it as necessary for the visualisation

draw - this draws the visualisation upon command

cleanup - this removes anything the visualisation draws

all information in the hub can be used, as it will typically be passed in as part of the constructor

See TemplateVisualisation.js for a stub example


2) The new visualisation needs to be included in the MetaSteamHub imports, 
and registered to a button at the end of the hub constructor using the format:

this.registerButton(*name of visualisation*, new *VisualisationObject*(this));
