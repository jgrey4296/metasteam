Grey (jgrey@soe.ucsc.edu): So how do you find Steam copes with that size of library?

Abe (abe@mail): Very poorly

Abe (abe@mail): I've used a lot of different tools to help categorize my library and they don't do a great job.


--------------------


Abe (abe@mail): Big Picture mode makes it a bit easier, with their categories. But it's still quite limited

Abe (abe@mail): Yeah I've used 3rd party tools that organize the categories you can set inside your steam library. So when you open up steam, your categories are set. But it doesn't do a great job.

Grey (jgrey@soe.ucsc.edu): Because of the categorisation, or the way Steam presents them to you (ie: a massive list)?

Abe (abe@mail): The way steam presents them to you mainly.

Abe (abe@mail): A massive list of hundreds of titles is very hard to look through when you're looking for something to play.


--------------------

Grey (jgrey@soe.ucsc.edu): You use the Steam Store as a means of browsing?

Abe (abe@mail): Unfortunately yes haha

Abe (abe@mail): Since theres no way of categorizing my OWN games in my library

Grey (jgrey@soe.ucsc.edu): without a significant time investment at least

Grey (jgrey@soe.ucsc.edu): Do you feel that means of browsing has contributed to buying more games, rather than using the ones you have already?


--------------------


Grey (jgrey@soe.ucsc.edu): From how you  are talking, it sounds like you use external sources to decide what to buy. What about when deciding what to play?


Abe (abe@mail): To be honest sometimes it comes down to a random number generator

Grey (jgrey@soe.ucsc.edu): a literal one?

Abe (abe@mail): Yeap haha


--------------------


Abe (abe@mail): I spend the majority of my time playing dota2 with friends

Abe (abe@mail): if I'm not playing that i look for a filler game, but I have too many at this point so I don't know what to choose.


--------------------


Abe (abe@mail): Yeah it depends on how much time I have to spend on a game. If I have a lot of time I'll try an adventure game where I can get through the storyline.

Abe (abe@mail): Whereas if I only have 20 minutes to play I'll maybe play a game that can be started and stopped at anytime without much issues with savepoints


--------------------


Grey (jgrey@soe.ucsc.edu): Whats the failure rate of that? Ever looked at a game in your library and said 'I.. have no idea what that game is about'

Abe (abe@mail): Yeah quite a bit of times, it's usually because of the bundles I buy.


--------------------

On Depressurizer:


Abe (abe@mail): I used it for a bit, but didn't really like it.

Abe (abe@mail): I think it just tried to go into your steam installation and set manual categories. Which is nice and all, but still didn't really help as much as I thought it would.

Grey (jgrey@soe.ucsc.edu): Because it was still a list?

Abe (abe@mail): Yeap


--------------------


Grey (jgrey@soe.ucsc.edu): How did you find that side of things? The installation and setup, and the ability to have it start (or install potentially) games

Abe (abe@mail): It's definitely handy! I usually just start games through steam since it's not the biggest hassle to start a game, mainly to find one to play.


--------------------


Abe (abe@mail): The main thing I found helpful was the circle pack view. It gave a really new fresh way to look at the categories


--------------------


Abe (abe@mail): YeahA few of the things I wasn't really sure what they meant

Abe (abe@mail): for example the multiplayer tab i wasnt too sure what those numbers were


--------------------


Abe (abe@mail): I really like the concept of the updated/played tab actually

Abe (abe@mail): so when old games you have installed get updates you can try them out

Abe (abe@mail): and see whats new

Abe (abe@mail): Since thats practically how games like Diablo work. People play then get bored, and after a big patch they play again

Grey (jgrey@soe.ucsc.edu): Is that a new realisation, or something you'd wished for previously?

Abe (abe@mail): I think more of a new realization
