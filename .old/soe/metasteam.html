  <h1>MetaSteam</h1>
  <div>
    <p>MetaSteam is an attempt to provide an easier browsing experience for my Steam game library. The standard list view worked well enough in the days I had under 200 games. Now I have 600.
    </p>

    <p>   
      A library of 600 provides particular challenges when deciding what game you want to play. You can not keep all six hundred in mind at any one point to be able to decide. I have found myself doing multiple passes through the list, essentially running a tournament of which game to play. Organising by genre or other features of a game would be helpful, but steam does not do that automatically.

    <p>
      The solution was to write a program to sit on top of steam, extract information from it on what games I owned, and what games I had installed, and present that information in a usable way.
    </p>

    <p>This would, seemingly, be a perfect time to use the steam web api. Hahaha. no.</p>

    <p>Instead, I wrote a python program to scrape steam manifest files, a users steam profile page, and individual store pages, and output json for a number of d3 <a href="./circles.html">visualisations</a>.</p>
